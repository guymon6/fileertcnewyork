                <p class="content1 "  >  <p>The Employee Retention Tax Credit is available for all New York City Businesses still operating in their existing business as they were before and during the COVID Crisis that hit as a world-wide pandemic in the Winter and Spring of 2020.</p>

<p>Many businesses were forced to shut-down and close temporarily to customers to assist in the reduction of this virus. Many precautions were put in place and everyone and every business were expected to participate. </p>

<p>Most employers, including colleges, universities, hospitals and 501(c) organizations following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, can qualify for the credit.</p>

<p>Previously, the Consolidated Appropriations Act expanded qualifications to include businesses who took a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), including borrowers from the initial round of PPP who originally were ineligible to claim the tax credit.</p>

<p>Qualification is determined by one of two factors for eligible employers &mdash; and one of these factors must apply in the calendar quarter the employer wishes to utilize the credit:</p>

<p>Remember, the credit can only be taken on wages that are not forgiven or expected to be forgiven under PPP.</p>

<p>When determining the qualified wages that can be included, an employer must first determine the number of full-time employees.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the employee retention credit, a full-time employee is defined as one that in any calendar month in 2019 worked at least 30 hours per week or 130 hours in a month (this is the monthly equivalent of 30 hours per week) and the definition based on the employer shared responsibility provision in the ACA.</p>

<p>Employee Retention Credit &mdash; The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, enacted December 27, 2020, amended and extended the employee retention credit (and the availability of certain advance payments of the tax credits) under section 2301 of the CARES Act until June 30, 2021.</p>

<p>The American Rescue Plan Act, enacted March 11, 2021, added section 3134 to the Internal Revenue Code to amend and extend the employee retention credit (and the availability of certain advance payments of the tax credits) until December 31, 2021. </p>

<p> </p>

The American Rescue Plan Act, enacted March 11, 2021, added section 3134 to the Internal Revenue Code to amend and extend the employee retention credit (and the availability of certain advance payments of the tax credits) until December 31, 2021.
